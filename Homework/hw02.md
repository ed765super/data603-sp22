    This article focused on introducing NoSQL databases and shining a light on why they're better than relational databases. Relational Databases are what most people think of 
    when the term “database” is used: Rows & Columns with values inside and a header for each column. For the most part they can handle holding anything for any small scale 
    project. But what happens when that small scale project gets too big for its britches? Then it starts taking up too much time and space and starts getting slow. That's where 
    non-relational databases come in. NoSQL literally means “No SQL”. As in, it does not use SQL at all to manage any of the database’s data. Some non-relational databases 
    include: Key-value, Columnar, Document, & Graph databases.

     As the title suggests, This article is a comprehensive introduction into datalakes. A data lake is a centralized storage repository that holds a lot of raw data in its 
     original format. Similar to how NoSQL was a response to the limitations of SQL, Data lakes is a response to the limitations of data warehouses. Data warehouses are what you 
     see in cartoons: A large space filled with files and folders. A data lake holds the metadata (info like where the data is and how it's doing) and keeps unique ids that makes 
     it easier to find the actual data. Unlike the NoSQL article, this article makes it very clear that what they’re discussing (in this case data lakes) are not the perfect 
     solution due to issues regarding security, speed, and reliability. This leads to the author proceeding to introduce data lake houses which is kind of a middleground.
