# Research Proposal
## By: Nicholas Ogbonna
    As many coders and bug testers can attest to, reading someone else's code can be akin to navigating a deens rainforest with nothing but a monkey wrench. Hence the need for guidelines to ensure proper commenting and committing edicate. Three weeks ago during class, there was a minor tangent regarding the ethos on proper commenting & committing. I want to explore that in more detail. Specifically, I want to answer the following questions:
* Is there a universal committing/commenting rubric for data scientists or is it on an employer by employer basis
* Are there some unspoken rules that data scientists follow when committing
* Are there differences based on region?
* What is the consensus on when to commit in the world of data science?
* What all information should your comment contain
  * On that note, how much is too much?
I will explore these questions and more over the course of the next 3 months and merge them into a nice concise 5-6 minute medium-esc article.
