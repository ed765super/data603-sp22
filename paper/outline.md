# Topic
talk about annotation/comment strategies in big data technologies like Spark, Hive, etc

# Hook:
Reading uncommented code is akin to maneuvering around a dense forest. Hence why most languages have the ability to leave annotations and comments. The goal is to highlight crucial points in the program and record comments that specifically draw links to essential features. This can help with systematic preparation for other programmers making changes to the program or users trying to understand the code more. Annotating any text can also assist you in composing a well-written answer to those who come to you for questions about your code.

# Introduction
Goal: tackle the 5 W’s: Who what when where why
What are annotations (what)
What are comments
Why are they used (why)
Brief history on annotations & comments detailing who gave the sensation a name, where and when they were first used
# Body 1
## Goal: Now that we know what Annotations & Comments are and the history behind them, now we go into the actual strategies
	General Spark annotation & Commenting strategies
	General Hive annotation & strategies
	Interesting Big data tech strategies on commenting and annotations (Moving the second section)
# Body 2
## Goal: Answer the questions I posed in the proposal, but gear them towards big data tech
Is there a universal annotating/commenting rubric for SPARK/HIVE or is it on an employer by employer basis


Are there some unspoken rules that data scientists follow when annotating/commenting
Are there differences based on region?
What is the consensus on when & where to annotate/comment in the world of data science?
What all information should your comment contain
On that note, how much is too much?

# Body 3 (unneeded)

# Conclusion
Restate all topic sentences
Contain a call to action
Something cheeky
